HTTP is the protocol that powers the web. I have build a HTTP/1.1 server that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way I have learned about TCP servers, HTTP request syntax, and more.

I learned about how to extract data from the request, get and post a file according to the HTTP request.
And also about HTTP compression that allows you to compress data in order to improve efficency.
